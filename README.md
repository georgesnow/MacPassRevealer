MacPass Plugin - Global Keyboard shortcut to hide/unhide MacPass

In order to use this plugin you have to check off "Load unsecure plugins" and "Force loading of incompatiable Plugins"
This is due to the signing of the mplugin, which you should build locally on your machine. 
I do recommend testing it out before making part of your production use. 

Important Notes:

Single click of status bar icon will hide/show MacPass

Option+Click Quits MacPass

Control+Click shows Popover Menu

The keyboard shortcut is hard configured for Option+Command+` (HotKey updated)


Other Notes:
Added a Menubar icon for quick access

Hopefully, I will later add custmizating the keyboard shortcut.
