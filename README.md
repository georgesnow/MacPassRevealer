# MacPassRevealer
MacPass Plugin - Global Keyboard shortcut to hide/unhide MacPass

In order to use this plugin you have to check off "Force loading of incompatiable Plugins"
And you need to allow "Unsigned Plugins" --I don't have a Apple Developer Certificate
You can build locally on your machine. Signed version in the most recent release
I do recommend testing it out before making part of your production use. 

New Features: 

-Search context for unlocked databases based on app when hotkey is triggered

-Land focus field locked and unlocked databases

-Preferences option

-Lock current database

-Lock all databases 

-Control Click or just a Right click now show menu

-User Defined HotKey - Enable/Disable 

-Menubar Icon (status item) - requires restart of MacPass after Enable/Disable

  **the restart is required for future feature implementation
