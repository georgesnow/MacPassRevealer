MacPass Plugin - Global Keyboard shortcut to hide/unhide MacPass

In order to use this plugin you have to check off "Load unsecure plugins" and "Force loading of incompatiable Plugins"
This is due to the signing of the mplugin, which you should build locally on your machine. You also need to use and mark in the project build settings to use your own Mac Development signing Team.
I do recommend testing it out before making part of your production use. 
User feedback is welcome.

Important Notes:

-The keyboard shortcut is hard configured for Control+Option+`

-Single click while unhide MacPass

-Option click will quit MacPass

-Contrl double click will display a menu (Currently, only an option to Quit MacPass)


Other Notes:
Added a Menubar icon for quick access
Hopefully, I will later add custmizating the keyboard shortcut.
