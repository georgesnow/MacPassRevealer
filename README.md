MacPass Plugin - Global Keyboard shortcut to hide/unhide MacPass

In order to use this plugin you have to check off "Load unsecure plugins" and "Force loading of incompatiable Plugins"
This is due to the signing of the mplugin, which you should build locally on your machine. 
I do recommend testing it out before making part of your production use. 

Important Notes:

Global Autotype - if you are using GAutotpye as word of caution. 
I did notice on rare occasions Global Autotype would trigger.
This seemed to be related to using neighboring keys (ie..hitting both keys and trigging wrong event)

The keyboard shortcut is hard configured for Control+Option+`


Other Notes:
Added a Menubar icon for quick access
Hopefully, I will later add custmizating the keyboard shortcut.
